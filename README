Language::Basic - A perl module implementation of the BASIC computer language

The included basic.pl is a BASIC interpreter, which uses Language::Basic.

Documentation is included as POD in the .pm files. There's also a syntax
description in the file Syntax.

WARNING: don't let the RCS version number fool you. This is an ALPHA RELEASE.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Installation should be as simple as

    tar zvxf Language::Basic-*.*.gz
    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test (see if it works -- tell me if it doesn't)
    make install (if you really want to!)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Gregory Yob's classic BASIC adventure game, Hunt the Wumpus, is included for
your playing pleasure. (The game was apparently written before they invented
licenses. I hope he doesn't mind my distributing it.)

I invite comments, criticisms, bug reports, bug fixes, and ideas. Also,
if you've got any fun/interesting BASIC programs lying around that you'd
like to send me.

Stay tuned. In addition to minor boring upgrades of supported BASIC syntax
and functionality, (I need to decide how much time I want to waste on this
completely useless project.) I hope soon to release the results of my secret
project: an Eldritch Triangle of Interpretive Power!


Enjoy!
