Language::Basic - A perl module implementation of the BASIC computer language

Included scripts (in scripts/ directory until you make install):
- basic.pl runs BASIC programs from the command line 
- termbasic.pl is a Term::Readline application that lets you write code
  one line at a time and then run it.
- basic2pl.pl translates BASIC programs into Perl. (It's not
   pretty, but it's not as bad as you might think, either.)

Documentation is included as POD in the .pm files. There's also a syntax
description in the file Syntax.

WARNING: don't let the RCS version number fool you. This is an ALPHA RELEASE.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Installation should be as simple as

    tar zvxf Language::Basic-*.*.gz
    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install (if you really want to!)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Gregory Yob's classic BASIC adventure game, Hunt the Wumpus, is included for
your playing pleasure. (The game was apparently written before they invented
licenses. I hope he doesn't mind my distributing it.) Translating it to Perl,
and comparing it with the Perl Power Tools wump(6) port, are exercises left
to the reader.

I invite comments, criticisms, bug reports, bug fixes, and ideas. Also, feel
free to send along any fun/interesting BASIC programs you have lying around.
And please let me know if "make test" fails.  On the other hand, please check
the BUGS section of the Language::Basic man page before sending in bug reports.

Stay tuned for more excitement. See the TODO file for planned changes.
First, I plan to add some more BASIC functionality. Second, I hope to make
LB more robust and improve the Perl translation. Third and most exciting (and
evil), I hope soon to release the results of my secret project: Ye Eldritch
Triangle of Interpretation!


Enjoy!
