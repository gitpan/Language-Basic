Language::Basic - A perl module implementation of the BASIC computer language

The included basic.pl runs BASIC programs.

The included basic2pl.pl translates BASIC programs into Perl. (It's not
pretty, but it's not as bad as you might think, either.)

Documentation is included as POD in the .pm files. There's also a syntax
description in the file Syntax.

WARNING: don't let the RCS version number fool you. This is an ALPHA RELEASE.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Installation should be as simple as

    tar zvxf Language::Basic-*.*.gz
    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test (see if it works -- tell me if it doesn't)
    make install (if you really want to!)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Gregory Yob's classic BASIC adventure game, Hunt the Wumpus, is included for
your playing pleasure. (The game was apparently written before they invented
licenses. I hope he doesn't mind my distributing it.) Translating it to Perl,
and comparing it with the Perl Power Tools wump(6) port, are exercises left
to the reader.

I invite comments, criticisms, bug reports, bug fixes, and ideas. Also, feel
free to send along any fun/interesting BASIC programs you have lying around.

Stay tuned for more excitement. See the TODO file for planned changes.
First, I plan to add some more BASIC functionality. Second, David Glasser
is helping me make the module more robust, and he's sent a patch to make
a real (Term::Readline) interpreter. Third and most exciting (and evil), I hope
soon to release the results of my secret project: Ye Eldritch Triangle of
Interpretation!


Enjoy!
