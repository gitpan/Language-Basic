			README for Language::Basic 

Language::Basic is a Perl module implementation of the BASIC computer language
It allows you to run BASIC programs or translate them to Perl scripts.
Note that it implements 80's-era BASIC. Think Applesoft or GW-BASIC.

WARNING: don't let the RCS version number fool you. This is an ALPHA RELEASE.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mini-FAQ:

Q. How do I install it?
A1. tar zvxf Language::Basic-*.*.gz
    perl Makefile.PL; make
    Optionally, "make test" and "make install"
A2. See the INSTALL file for more details

Q. What's new?
A. See (the top of) the CHANGES file

Q. What exciting changes are planned for the future?
A1. More BASIC functionality, better error checking and documentation,
    and the evil secret project, Ye Eldritch Triangle of Interpretation
A2. See the TODO file

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Included Stuff:

Perl scripts (in scripts/ directory until you make install):
- basic.pl runs BASIC programs from the command line 
- termbasic.pl is a Term::Readline application that lets you write code
  one line at a time and then run it.
- basic2pl.pl translates BASIC programs into Perl. (It's not
   pretty, but it's not as bad as you might think, either.)

Documentation is included as POD in the .pm files. There's also a
description of the currently supported BASIC syntax in the 
Language::Basic::Syntax pod page. Documentation will be turned into man
pages by make, and installed by make install.

Gregory Yob's classic BASIC adventure game, Hunt the Wumpus, is included for
your playing pleasure. (The game was apparently written before they invented
software licenses. I hope he doesn't mind my distributing it.) Translating it
to Perl, and comparing it with the Perl Power Tools wump(6) port, are exercises
left to the reader.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I welcome comments, criticisms, bug reports, bug fixes, and ideas.  (But please
check the BUGS section of the Language::Basic man page before sending in bug
reports.) Actual patches are even more welcome. Also, feel free to send along
any fun/interesting BASIC programs you have lying around.

Enjoy!
