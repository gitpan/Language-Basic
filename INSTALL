I believe Language::Basic's installation is pretty darn standard, so most
folks shouldn't have to read most of the following.

    tar zvxf Language::Basic-*.*.gz
    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install

The last two steps are optional.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Please let me know if "make test" fails.  If you'd like to  be really helpful, 
try something like:

	make test TEST_VERBOSE=1 TEST_FILES="t/foo.t t/bar.t"

This will run just the given test script(s) and print out the BASIC program it
ran, the expected output, and the output it received, for each failed test.
Language::Basic ought to be platform-independent, but if it's not, the
output you get could be very helpful in fixing the problem.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you want to run scripts before doing a make install, try something like:

    perl -Iblib/lib blib/script/basic.pl foo.bas

If you want to write a program that uses Language::Basic without installing
it, add the following line to the script:

    use lib qw (blib/lib)

If the program you're writing isn't in the Language-Basic-?.? directory, it may
look like one of these (depending on the version number, user name, etc.)

    use lib qw (/home/lwall/favorites/Language-Basic-1.44)
or
    use lib qw (foo/bar/Language-Basic-3.17)
